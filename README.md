## Technologies Used

**Transformers Library**: The project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides a wide range of pre-trained models, including GPT models, for natural language processing tasks. The library offers an easy-to-use interface for fine-tuning models and generating summaries based on the GPT architecture.

**Flask**: Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows for the development of web applications. In TextXtract, Flask is used to create the backend server that handles requests, processes text summarization, and provides APIs for frontend communication.

**React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In TextXtract, React is used for developing the frontend interface, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.

**Axios**: Axios is a JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend server. It facilitates communication between the React frontend and the Flask backend in TextXtract.
